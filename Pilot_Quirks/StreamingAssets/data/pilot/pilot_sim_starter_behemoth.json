      "Details" : "Miranda Aguilera grew up in the Lyran Commonwealth. She was a tall kid who made a name for herself as 'the girl you don't mess with.' At eighteen, she signed up with a small-time mercenary company to feed her growing wanderlust. Miranda went undefeated in her crew's drinking games - and in the brawling that usually followed. When her fellow mercenaries turned to piracy, she was in. When they turned over a new leaf, she was out, and looking for a tougher crew.\r\n\r\n<b>• Criminal:</b> Chance to steal from the company. Increase in chance to find specials at Black Market systems.\r\n\r\n<b>• Military:</b> Minor increase in starting XP.\r\n\r\n<b>• Spacer:</b> Reduced maintenance costs for this pilot.\r\n\r\n<b>• Brave:</b> Bonus to resist pilot panic.",

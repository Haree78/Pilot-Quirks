        "Details": "Lantalia Metke was the eldest child of one of the Counts of Galax, in the Federated Suns. She was a bright, but deeply withdrawn child. After a standard battery of psychological testing indicated a need for medical intervention, she was sent to New Avalon and her younger brother replaced her in the stressful position of Metke heir.\r\n\r\nWhile she was primarily on New Avalon for assistance with her gender transition, the early treatment encouraged her to overcome her withdrawal and soon she found a place as the protege of a noted AI researcher. After graduating from her academy early, she chose to return to Galax to do avionics development for Boeing and was assigned her to a roaming dropship recovery team.\r\n\r\nWhen her team was attacked while on assignment, she was the only survivor, and dying of dehydration herself when a mercenary company boarded the drifting ship and rescued her. After bonding with the mercenaries, she decided to stay with them for a while. They trained her as a backup pilot. Unfortunately, when a crisis came that required her skills, she alone was not enough to save the day. While the civilians her company was defending survived, her friends did not.\r\n\r\nNow she drifts around the Periphery, intermittently working as a mercenary pilot. She has an invitation to work at the New Avalon Institute of Science with her mentor, a standing offer from Boeing to work for them again, and a family that misses her. But she has lost two crews, two sets of friends, and she is not yet sure what she's ready to lose next.\r\n\r\n<b>• Noble:</b> Increased pilot maintenance and mood changes upon funding level\r\n\r\n<b>• Bookish:</b> Increased Tactics but decreased Gunnery, Piloting, and Guts.\r\n\r\n<b>• Tech:</b> Improved 'Mech Repair Times.\r\n\r\n<b>• Spacer:</b> Reduced maintenance costs for this pilot.\r\n\r\n<b>• Mechwarrior:</b> Moderate increase in starting XP.",
